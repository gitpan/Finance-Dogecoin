=head1 NAME

Finance::Dogecoin::API - use the dogeapi.com API from Perl

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Finance::Dogecoin::API;

    # may throw errors
    eval {
        my $dc      = Finance::Dogecoin::API->new( api_key => $SECRET_KEY );
        my $block   = $dc->get_current_block;
        my $price   = $dc->get_current_price;

        my $balance = $dc->get_balance;
        my $result  = $dc->withdraw(
            payment_address => $ADDY, amount => $AMOUNT
        );
    };

    # tip the author
    $dc->withdraw(
        payment_address => 'DPxuFc7dhNrTvNMCE53ENGF5g7LSGrzyYs',
        amount          => 5,
    );

=head1 DESCRIPTION

C<Finance::Dogecoin::API> provides an OO interface to the Dogecoin API provided
by L<http://dogeapi.com/>. You need to sign up for an API key to use most of
the methods in this class; do so at the site. When creating the object, you
must provide the C<api_key> as a constructor argument.

=head1 METHODS

This module provides several methods. See the documentation at
L<https://www.dogeapi.com/api_documentation> for current details. These methods
may I<all> throw an exception if a network error or protocol error occurs, so
be ready to catch them:

=head2 get_current_price()

Returns the current price of Dogecoins in US dollars. This is a floating point
number.

=head2 get_current_block()

Returns the current block of Doge mining.

=head2 get_difficulty()

Returns the current difficulty of Doge mining.

=head2 get_balance()

Returns the balance of your entire account across all wallets. This is a
floating point number.

=head2 get_my_addresses()

Returns an array reference of all payment addresses associated with your
account. This array may be empty.

=head2 withdraw( payment_address => $address, amount => $amount )

Withdraws C<$amount> from your account and sends it to <$address>. The API and
the Doge network each charge a modest transaction fee. The transaction will
fail unless your account meets these criteria. In particular, you must transfer
at least 5 Doge at a time.

If you do not provide I<both> the C<payment_address> and C<amount> parameters,
this method will throw an exception.

=head2 get_new_address( address_label => $label )

Creates and returns a new payment address for your account. You may provide an
I<optional> C<address_label> parameter. The API will use this alphanumeric
value as the label if possible.

=head2 get_address_received( payment_address => $address )

Returns the current amount of Dogecoins recieved at the given address or label.
This method will throw an exception if you do not provide either the
C<payment_address> or C<address_label> parameters. This method will return the
number C<0> if you provide an invalid address or label.

=head2 get_address_by_label( address_label => $label )

Returns the payment address for the given address label. This method will throw
an exception if you do not provide the C<address_label> parameter. This method
will return the string C<No matching addresses> if there are no matching
addresses.

=head1 CAVEATS

The Dogecoin API is under development, so these methods might change and new
methods might appear.
